# Issues
- Make release build
- Test release build without overwrite in untouched, vrik, vrik+higgs, +hapticskyrimvr +sprintjumpvr scenarios
- Spawn fewer threads
- Balancing: Compensate reduced spell animation time by increasing charge time
- Make config system easier to use (use rex_ini option, auto generate papyrus side?)
- ???
