# Issues
- Fix left handed mode
- Remove logging
- Disable spell equip/unequip animations (for faster spellsiphoning). Or maybe just shorten them?
- Allow shouting while casting spells
- Spawn fewer threads
- Balancing: Compensate reduced spell animation time by increasing charge time
- Make config system easier to use (use rex_ini option, auto generate papyrus side?)
- ???
