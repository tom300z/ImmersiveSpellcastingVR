# Issues

- Port to commonlibng? https://github.com/libxse/commonlibsse-ng-template/tree/main
- Move custom animations into project and integrate into build steps
- Remove static paths from build steps (use env vars)
- Higgs touch input patch
- Make release build
- Test release build without overwrite in untouched, vrik, vrik+higgs, +hapticskyrimvr +sprintjumpvr scenarios
- Spawn fewer threads
- Balancing: Compensate reduced spell animation time by increasing charge time
- Make config system easier to use (auto generate papyrus side?)
- ???
