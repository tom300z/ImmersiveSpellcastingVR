# Issues
- Fix unwanted animations in MGO. Maybe modify them at runtime (Look at dynamic animation replacer)
- Run input dispatcher in UI thread, maybe hook PollInputDevices
- Balancing: Compensate reduced spell animation time by increasing charge time
- Make config system easier to use (use rex_ini option, auto generate papyrus side?)
- ???
